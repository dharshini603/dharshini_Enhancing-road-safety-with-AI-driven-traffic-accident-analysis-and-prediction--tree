# Enhancing Road Safety with AI-Driven Traffic Accident Analysis and Prediction

This project aims to improve road safety by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to analyze traffic accident data and predict high-risk situations. 
By identifying patterns and trends in historical crash data, the system helps stakeholders—such as city planners, traffic authorities, and autonomous vehicle systems—take proactive steps to prevent future accidents
## 🚗 Key Features

* 📊 **Traffic Accident Data Analysis**: In-depth analysis of crash datasets using AI.
* 🤖 **Predictive Modeling**: ML models trained to predict accident likelihood based on various factors (weather, time, location, etc.).
* 🌍 **Geospatial Risk Mapping**: Visual representation of high-risk areas on interactive maps.
* ⚠️ **Real-Time Alerts (Optional)**: Potential for integration with real-time systems for live predictions and alerts.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch)
* Jupyter Notebooks
* GeoPandas / Folium / Plotly for visualizations
* Flask / FastAPI (optional API layer)
* Public datasets (e.g., US DOT, Kaggle crash data)
